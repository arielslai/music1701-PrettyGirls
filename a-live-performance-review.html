Reneé Rapp waves around a lesbian pride flag high above her head on stage at Roundhouse London on February 3, 2024. She jumps, grinning ear to ear, as she points her mic toward the audience. “Yeah your boyfriend’s cute–” she sings, and without missing a beat, the crowd explodes: “NO HE’S NOT!” It’s a thrilling call-and-response moment built around an inside joke that really shows the connection between Rapp and her fans. This is more than just a tour stop– it’s a celebration, a safe space where queer joy radiates through every cheer of Rapp’s lyrics. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This performance of “Pretty Girls” at Roundhouse London showed exactly why songs like “Pretty Girls” that shine light on the queer experience matter today. LGBTQ+ representation in music has become more common nowadays compared to a century ago, but there’s still a long way to go, and Rapp tapped into something deeply personal–</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the experience of being treated as a romantic experiment and being objectified by bicurious or seemingly straight women.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> As conversations around compulsory heterosexuality, that is the societal expectation for people to be straight, and authentic queer representation gained momentum, “Pretty Girls” resonated with queer youths seeking to see their own experiences represented in music. Music industry studies researcher Joey Tan argued that artists should use their platforms to create safe spaces where queer individuals are supported and celebrated (Tan 2018, 4), and Rapp did just that– not just by advocating for representation, but by making her her fans feel truly seen and valued through her music and concert experiences. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the moment she stepped on stage, Rapp’s performance crackled with energy. She commanded the stage, interacting with the audience like old friends at a house party. “Sing it!” she’d yell, prompting deafening responses. “What?” she’d tease, smirking as the crowd roared back. There was an undeniable sense of community in the room– inside jokes, laughters, and an overwhelming feeling of belonging that the crowd showed through their enthusiasm. It’s the kind of connection Tan argued artists are responsible for creating in their music, and Rapp nailed it effortlessly. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rapp’s energetic live performance didn’t only elevate the song– it turned “Pretty Girls” into something more intense, making every lyric hit harder and every beat feel more alive. The chorus tells a two-part story, and Rapp’s delivery made the contrast between wild exhilaration and gut-punch regret even sharper. In the first half of the chorus, Rapp embodied the energy of tipsy girls at a nightclub, embracing the moment, flirting, and experimenting. “They have a couple of drinks, all the pretty girls, so now they wanna kiss all the pretty girls,” she sang with punchy and energetic vocals, jumping and waving the pride flag like she’s the life of the party. Her band’s pulsing bass and choppy beats, the sonic equivalent of neon lights flashing over a crowded nightclub, mirrored this reckless excitement. But then, the mood shifted. As she moved onto the second part of the chorus, the drums faded, the melody stretched out, and Rapp's voice softened into a slurred, aching delivery. “In the P.M. all the pretty girls act like it never happened in another world,” she belted with raw intensity, taking her voice up an octave. We could hear her frustration seeping into every note, which made the disappointment cut even deeper. It was raw, honest, and gave actual goosebumps– painting an image of Rapp sitting alone in her bedroom, processing the night before. The way she played with her vocal dynamics, changing up the melody of the original song, painted a more gut-wrenching image and kept the audience hooked.  </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lyrically, the track dived into themes of compulsory heterosexuality and queer women being treated as experiments. “I like your straight jacket,” the crowd roared during the performance. Rapp nodded and sang back, “but it feels like it’s a little tight,” as if responding directly to them. Through these lyrics, Rapp called attention to how normalized society’s pressure to suppress women’s true identities has become. Hearing thousands of voices shouting the line together, as if affirming they’ve broken free from that suppression, was nothing short of electrifying– the sound of self-acceptance echoing through the venue. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many compare “Pretty Girls” to Katy Perry’s “I Kissed a Girl,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a track both praised for opening up the discussion for bisexual rights and criticized for fetishizing queer women.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Dorian Sinclair from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Singles Jukebox </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">saw Rapp’s version as being from the perspective of the girl that was kissed in Perry’s hit, offering a different take on the story (Sinclair, in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Singles’ Jukebox </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">2023). This perspective adds depth to Rapp’s lyric “it’s a blessing and it’s a curse,” which Rapp delivers with a soft, almost breathless honesty in her vocals. She captures the bittersweet experience of being validated by someone’s attraction while also grappling with the pain of being viewed as an experiment. In an interview with Elle, she reflected on the song’s meaning, explaining, “This is something that you’re discovering about yourself, and you might be objectifying me in the process. And that sometimes fuckin’ sucks, but that’s also sometimes the way it goes. (Rapp, in Gonzales)” She calls out this hurtful behavior while also acknowledging that experiments are often a necessary part of queer self-realization– an experience that deeply resonates with many of her fans who have gone through the same thing. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the time the performance ended, one thing was clear: Reneé Rapp isn’t just making pop music– she’s creating a space where queer youths feel safe, seen, and celebrated. “Pretty Girls” wasn’t just a song– it was a reflection of the audience’s experiences: joy, frustration, and the longing to be truly valued. In that moment, the audience wasn’t just watching a performance; they were witnessing their own stories take center stage in the music industry through Rapp’s performance. And for every person singing along, “Pretty Girls” was more than just pulsing beats and pop lyrics– it was proof that they belonged.</span></p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
