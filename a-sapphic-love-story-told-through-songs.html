She watches her best friend lean in, the scent of cheap vodka lingering on her breath. Suddenly, a kiss. Unexpected, thrilling, and over too soon. You’d be surprised how a brief moment can change everything. The next morning, the air between them is thick with silence, and the careful avoidance feels like a slap to her face. For one of them, it was playful experimentation; it was heartbreak for the other.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The kiss is just the breaking point. One of them had spent years pretending friendship was enough, hoping her feelings would disappear. The other never questioned what they had—until now. Suddenly, the world doesn’t feel as certain as it once did.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This playlist tells that story—the agonizing realization, the painful in-between of denial and longing, and the terrifying but relieving process of finally understanding yourself. Featuring queer artists like Reneé Rapp, Chappell Roan, Clairo, and Girl in Red, these songs follow the complex journey from fleeting moments to something real, following the perspectives of both girls in this “situationship.” And even when love finally happens, it’s never that simple. There’s still the fear of wondering who will accept them, who won’t, and why it even has to be a question in the first place. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This compilation of songs isn’t only about falling in love with your best friend. It’s about queer love, bisexuality, and lesbianism—about how they’re dismissed, questioned, treated as a phase. It’s about the fear and doubt of embracing who you are, and the uncertainty of whether anyone will truly understand and accept you.</span></p><p> </p><h6>Reneé Rapp. “I Do” from Snow Angel (Deluxe). Interscope Records: 2023.</h6><table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 103.561%; height: 486px; border-style: hidden;" border="0"><tbody><tr style="height: 535.359px;"><td style="width: 62.4834%; border-style: hidden; vertical-align: top; height: 535.359px;"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the kiss was years of stolen glances, lingering touches, and a closeness that blur the lines between platonic friendship and romance. In “I Do,” Reneé Rapp captures this aching contradiction: the pleasure of being close to someone you love and the devastating reality that they don’t love you the same way. When Rapp sings, “And then you get comfortable on my shoulder / I’d thank my lucky stars but it’s tearing me apart,” it represents the emotional tug-of-war of being the girl who loves her best friend the “wrong” way, forced to suppress feelings just to keep the friendship intact. “It's like we're both looking up / And I'm under a storm, and you're seeing sky-blue,” Rapp belts in a way that invokes goosebumps, causing listeners to empathize with her unrequited love. The soaring vocals and emotional intensity set the stage for the heartbreak that follows.</span></p></td><td style="width: 37.5176%; border-style: hidden; vertical-align: middle; height: 535.359px;"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe width="100%" height="352" style="border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/7MuPMuMfGIYZCt6QuBX3Oy?utm_source=generator&amp;theme=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div></td></tr></tbody></table><h6> </h6><h6>Katy Perry. “I Kissed a Girl.” Capitol Records: 2008.</h6><table style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal); width: 106.838%; height: 535.352px; border-style: hidden;" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr style="height: 535.352px;"><td style="width: 38.8%; border-style: hidden; vertical-align: top; height: 535.352px;"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe width="100%" height="352" style="border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/1pXrR5Y9OgcIV2JEAl2lCB?utm_source=generator&amp;theme=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div></td><td style="width: 61.2%; border-style: hidden; vertical-align: top; height: 535.352px;"><p><span>Then comes the kiss—the moment everything shifts. It’s impulsive and unexpected: a drunken experiment with consequences that only one of them is ready to face. "I Kissed a Girl" by Katy Perry conveys this situation from the opposite perspective: the best friend who never considered this possibility. Lyrics like “This was never the way I planned, not my intention” and “You're my experimental game” reflect her detachment, the way she moves on easily, unaware of the heartbreak she leaves behind. The upbeat, carefree melody further adds to the lightheartedness of the situation viewed from the best friend’s perspective—it’s fun for her, but for the other, it’s the beginning of something much more complicated.</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
