She watches her best friend lean in, the scent of cheap vodka lingering on her breath. Suddenly, a kiss. Unexpected, thrilling, and over too soon. You’d be surprised how a brief moment can change everything. The next morning, the air between them is thick with silence, and the careful avoidance feels like a slap to her face. For one of them, it was playful experimentation; it was heartbreak for the other.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The kiss is just the breaking point. One of them had spent years pretending friendship was enough, hoping her feelings would disappear. The other never questioned what they had—until now. Suddenly, the world doesn’t feel as certain as it once did.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This playlist tells that story—the agonizing realization, the painful in-between of denial and longing, and the terrifying but relieving process of finally understanding yourself. Featuring queer artists like Reneé Rapp, Chappell Roan, Clairo, and Girl in Red, these songs follow the complex journey from fleeting moments to something real, following the perspectives of both girls in this “situationship.” And even when love finally happens, it’s never that simple. There’s still the fear of wondering who will accept them, who won’t, and why it even has to be a question in the first place. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This compilation of songs isn’t only about falling in love with your best friend. It’s about queer love, bisexuality, and lesbianism—about how they’re dismissed, questioned, treated as a phase. It’s about the fear and doubt of embracing who you are, and the uncertainty of whether anyone will truly understand and accept you.</span></p><p> </p><h5>Reneé Rapp. “I Do” from Snow Angel (Deluxe). Interscope Records: 2023.</h5><table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 110.114%; height: 496.359px; border-style: hidden;" border="0"><tbody><tr style="height: 496.359px;"><td style="width: 62.4491%; border-style: hidden; vertical-align: top; height: 496.359px;"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the kiss was years of stolen glances, lingering touches, and a closeness that blur the lines between platonic friendship and romance. In “I Do,” Reneé Rapp captures this aching contradiction: the pleasure of being close to someone you love and the devastating reality that they don’t love you the same way. When Rapp sings, “And then you get comfortable on my shoulder / I’d thank my lucky stars but it’s tearing me apart,” it represents the emotional tug-of-war of being the girl who loves her best friend the “wrong” way, forced to suppress feelings just to keep the friendship intact. “It's like we're both looking up / And I'm under a storm, and you're seeing sky-blue,” Rapp belts in a way that invokes goosebumps, causing listeners to empathize with her unrequited love. The soaring vocals and emotional intensity set the stage for the heartbreak that follows.</span></p></td><td style="width: 37.552%; border-style: hidden; vertical-align: top; height: 496.359px;"><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/media/posts/5/IMG_2255.jpg" alt="" width="264" height="365" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/media/posts/5/responsive/IMG_2255-xs.jpg 640w, https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/media/posts/5/responsive/IMG_2255-sm.jpg 768w, https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/media/posts/5/responsive/IMG_2255-md.jpg 1024w, https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/media/posts/5/responsive/IMG_2255-lg.jpg 1366w, https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/media/posts/5/responsive/IMG_2255-xl.jpg 1600w, https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/media/posts/5/responsive/IMG_2255-2xl.jpg 1920w"></figure></td></tr></tbody></table><h5>Katy Perry. “I Kissed a Girl.” Capitol Records: 2008.</h5><table style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal); width: 110.114%; height: 440.352px; border-style: hidden;" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr style="height: 440.352px;"><td style="width: 38.8239%; border-style: hidden; vertical-align: top; height: 440.352px;"><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/media/posts/5/IMG_2257.jpg" alt="" width="637" height="924" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/media/posts/5/responsive/IMG_2257-xs.jpg 640w, https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/media/posts/5/responsive/IMG_2257-sm.jpg 768w, https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/media/posts/5/responsive/IMG_2257-md.jpg 1024w, https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/media/posts/5/responsive/IMG_2257-lg.jpg 1366w, https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/media/posts/5/responsive/IMG_2257-xl.jpg 1600w, https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/media/posts/5/responsive/IMG_2257-2xl.jpg 1920w"></figure></td><td style="width: 61.1771%; border-style: hidden; vertical-align: top; height: 440.352px;"><p>Then comes the kiss—the moment everything shifts. It’s impulsive and unexpected: a drunken experiment with consequences that only one of them is ready to face. "I Kissed a Girl" by Katy Perry conveys this situation from the opposite perspective: the best friend who never considered this possibility. Lyrics like “This was never the way I planned, not my intention” and “You're my experimental game” reflect her detachment, the way she moves on easily, unaware of the heartbreak she leaves behind. The upbeat, carefree melody further adds to the lightheartedness of the situation viewed from the best friend’s perspective—it’s fun for her, but for the other, it’s the beginning of something much more complicated.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h5>Reneé Rapp. “Pretty Girls” from Snow Angel. Interscope Records: 2023.</h5><table style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal); width: 110.114%; height: 542.359px; border-style: hidden;" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr style="height: 542.359px;"><td style="width: 60.6727%; border-style: hidden; vertical-align: top; height: 542.359px;"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The aftermath is painful. They both pretend nothing happened, but the weight of it lingers. The lyrics of "Pretty Girls" perfectly encapsulate this push and pull: “It’s a blessing and it’s a curse,” Rapp sings. While the kiss confirmed everything, it also made things worse. The tension simmers beneath the surface, unspoken but inescapable. Rapp’s melancholic yet powerful delivery mirrors the confusion, the hope that maybe this could mean something, and the painful realization that, for now, it doesn’t. “Pretty Girls” was placed right after “I Kissed a Girl” in this playlist to provide juxtaposition between the two girls’ perspectives. Rapp’s lyrics in “Pretty Girls” greatly show her attachment and attraction towards her best friend, while Perry solely sings about how much she enjoyed the kiss, contrasting the two girls’ motives. Despite the difference in lyrics, both songs have an upbeat melody, which both simulate the pulsing beats at a nightclub or bar.</span></p></td><td style="width: 39.3273%; border-style: hidden; vertical-align: top; height: 542.359px;"><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/media/posts/5/IMG_2253.jpg" alt="" width="646" height="933" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/media/posts/5/responsive/IMG_2253-xs.jpg 640w, https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/media/posts/5/responsive/IMG_2253-sm.jpg 768w, https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/media/posts/5/responsive/IMG_2253-md.jpg 1024w, https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/media/posts/5/responsive/IMG_2253-lg.jpg 1366w, https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/media/posts/5/responsive/IMG_2253-xl.jpg 1600w, https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/media/posts/5/responsive/IMG_2253-2xl.jpg 1920w"></figure></td></tr></tbody></table><h5>Chappell Roan. “Good luck babe.” Island Records: 2024.</h5><table style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal); width: 110.114%; height: 466.352px; border-style: hidden;" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr style="height: 466.352px;"><td style="width: 41.2678%; border-style: hidden; vertical-align: top; height: 466.352px;"><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/media/posts/5/IMG_2259.jpg" alt="" width="657" height="916" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/media/posts/5/responsive/IMG_2259-xs.jpg 640w, https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/media/posts/5/responsive/IMG_2259-sm.jpg 768w, https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/media/posts/5/responsive/IMG_2259-md.jpg 1024w, https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/media/posts/5/responsive/IMG_2259-lg.jpg 1366w, https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/media/posts/5/responsive/IMG_2259-xl.jpg 1600w, https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/media/posts/5/responsive/IMG_2259-2xl.jpg 1920w"></figure></td><td style="width: 58.7322%; border-style: hidden; vertical-align: top; height: 466.352px;"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But here’s the thing about suppressing feelings—it never really works. No matter how hard she tries to shove it down, the truth is clawing its way back up. Chappell Roan’s "Good Luck, Babe!" can be seen as the lesbian girl warning her best friend that hiding this part of herself will only cause harm. Roan sings directly to the girl who does not acknowledge what’s right in front of her, refusing to let her ignore it for any longer. The line “I don’t wanna call it off / But you don’t wanna call it love” is a direct challenge, a mirror to Perry’s line “Don’t mean I’m in love tonight” in “I Kissed a Girl.” “Good Luck, Babe!” is the perfect response to the dismissal after their kiss, prompting her best friend to embrace who she is and be honest to herself. </span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><h5>Girl in Red. “Girls” from Beginnings. World in Red: 2019. </h5><table style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal); width: 110.114%; height: 462.859px; border-style: hidden;" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr style="height: 462.859px;"><td style="width: 60.6727%; border-style: hidden; vertical-align: top; height: 462.859px;"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the first time, she lets herself question what this all means. Who am I? Is this allowed? "Girls" by Girl in Red captures this internal struggle—the fear of admitting something you don’t quite understand yet, and the realization that maybe this isn’t something she can ignore anymore. “They’re so pretty, it hurts,” Girl in Red sings, mirroring the lyrics of “Pretty Girls” from earlier in the playlist. But this time, it’s different. This time it’s the best friend seeing her this way. What was once unrequited love has shifted into something more. The lyrics “I should be into this guy, but it's just a waste of time,” speaks to the realization that what she’s always assumed about herself might not be true. This song marks the turning point: the moment when uncertainty starts feeling less like fear and more like possibility. </span></p></td><td style="width: 39.3273%; border-style: hidden; vertical-align: top; height: 462.859px;"><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/media/posts/5/IMG_2261.jpg" alt="" width="659" height="923" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/media/posts/5/responsive/IMG_2261-xs.jpg 640w, https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/media/posts/5/responsive/IMG_2261-sm.jpg 768w, https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/media/posts/5/responsive/IMG_2261-md.jpg 1024w, https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/media/posts/5/responsive/IMG_2261-lg.jpg 1366w, https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/media/posts/5/responsive/IMG_2261-xl.jpg 1600w, https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/media/posts/5/responsive/IMG_2261-2xl.jpg 1920w"></figure><p> </p></td></tr></tbody></table><h5>Clairo. “Sofia” from Immunity.

Clairo’s "Sofia" shifts the tone of the playlist into a softer and more hopeful one. It’s the reassurance that, even if the world doesn’t understand, this love is real. The melody is gentle, paired with Clairo’s quiet and light vocals that carries a comforting warmth. “Sofia, know that you and I / Shouldn’t feel like a crime” speaks directly to the doubt that lingers, offering a steady certainty. The push and pull from “Good Luck, Babe!” and the doubt in “Girls” is now fading into something simpler. </span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><h5>MUNA (feat.

"Silk Chiffon" is the soundtrack to falling in love:  fully and without hesitation. The best friends who were once tangled in uncertainty are now tangled in each other, and for the first time, they don’t care who’s watching. MUNA’s signature bright, synth-heavy production makes this song impossible not to dance to. This infectious energy mirrors the rush of falling in love. “Like, life's so fun, life's so fun” captures the giddiness, the feeling of getting to love freely. Phoebe Bridgers’ feature adds a softness to the track, her vocals adding a calmness to the song’s upbeat energy. "Silk chiffon / That's how it feels, oh, when she's on me" captures the ease of being in love, the way their relationship no longer feels like a challenge, but something comforting and weightless. This song is a celebration of queer love: carefree, comforting, and fully unapologetic.</span></p></td><td style="width: 39.3273%; border-style: hidden; vertical-align: top; height: 448.359px;"><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/media/posts/5/IMG_2266-3.jpg" alt="" width="648" height="921" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/media/posts/5/responsive/IMG_2266-3-xs.jpg 640w, https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/media/posts/5/responsive/IMG_2266-3-sm.jpg 768w, https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/media/posts/5/responsive/IMG_2266-3-md.jpg 1024w, https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/media/posts/5/responsive/IMG_2266-3-lg.jpg 1366w, https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/media/posts/5/responsive/IMG_2266-3-xl.jpg 1600w, https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/media/posts/5/responsive/IMG_2266-3-2xl.jpg 1920w"></figure><p> </p></td></tr></tbody></table><h5>Vivi Rincon. “if we lived on the moon” from overflow.

Vivi Rincon’s "if we lived on the moon" is a quiet reflection on this truth– on the way queer love is still questioned and forced to justify itself. The melancholic melody carries a bittersweet weight, acknowledging that there’s still something to fight against. “And nothing like this could be wrong” is both a declaration and a frustration, a reminder that their love is real, even when others refuse to see it that way. The longing in the lyrics, “If people on Earth think that they know us better than we do, then I’ll live on the moon with you,” captures the deep exhaustion of always having to explain and defend queer love. It may seem like the playlist ends in sadness, but really, it ends in defiance. This song shows that even in a world that tries to diminish them, their love is unwavering.</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p> </p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This playlist isn’t just about falling for your best friend. It’s about the messy, thrilling, and sometimes painful journey of queer love. From the heartbreak of “I Do” to the euphoric freedom of “Silk Chiffon,” each song marks a step towards self-acceptance and love without hesitation. But even when happiness arrives, “if we lived on the moon” reminds us that the world still questions what shouldn’t need defending. However, the story doesn’t end in doubt; it ends in defiance. This playlist shows how queer love is often dismissed, ignored, or treated as a phase. But it isn’t. It is valid, undeniable, and worth celebrating. No matter how homophobia tries to belittle them, they exist, and they love, unapologetically.</span></p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
