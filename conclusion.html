It’s a cultural moment: a lens through which we can see how queerness is received, consumed, and often misrepresented in mainstream media. This project has explored how “Pretty Girls” captures the emotional complexity of bicuriosity, queer longing, and identity through live performance, visual storytelling, lyrical vulnerability. Whether through audience call-and-response, a gut-punch of a music video, or quiet moments in playlists, Rapp makes queer experiences visible, raw, and real.</p><p data-start="798" data-end="1370">What gives her this power? As music experts Loy, Rickwood, and Bennett explain in <em data-start="866" data-end="900">Popular Music, Stars and Stardom</em>, artists who present themselves with authenticity often build stronger, more loyal fan connections (Loy, Rickwood, and Bennett 2018). Rapp’s growing influence, particularly among LGBTQ+ fans, isn’t just about talent—it’s about trust. Her willingness to be vulnerable has elevated her beyond celebrity into something closer to stardom. And with that comes power: the ability to shift conversations, shape representation, and create safer spaces in an industry that doesn’t always prioritize those things.</p><p data-start="1372" data-end="2078">But queer advocacy, while essential, is just one piece of the conversation. As journalist Mark Savage documents in his BBC article on racism in the music industry, many marginalized artists—particularly Black women—still face systemic barriers, from pay disparity to stereotyping (Savage 2021). While Rapp’s openness as a queer white woman is powerful, it’s important to recognize that advocacy in music must also include race, gender, class, and more. The industry’s tendency to tokenize, commodify, or silence voices that don’t fit the mainstream narrative remains a challenge. If we truly care about representation, we need to expand the conversation beyond queerness to include all identities that are erased or misrepresented.</p><p data-start="2080" data-end="2324">“Pretty Girls” is just one story, but it sparks a bigger one. It reminds us that music can be a space for queer joy and heartbreak—but also a space for truth. And artists like Rapp, who dare to be honest, can help change the story for everyone.</p><p class="align-center" data-start="2080" data-end="2324"> </p><p class="align-center" data-start="2080" data-end="2324"><a href="https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/introduction.html">Restart</a></p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
