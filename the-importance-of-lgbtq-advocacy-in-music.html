Tan argues that since LGBTQ+ individuals make up a significant portion of the contemporary music listeners, it is the music artists’ responsibility to use their platform to initiate change by sharing LGBTQ+ positive messages through their music and or actions (Tan 2018, 4). In this article, Tan draws on a mix of industry reports and case studies of LGBTQ+ musicians that happened in recent years. The sources that Tan uses include statistics from GLAAD and the Music Business Association, which provide data on LGBTQ+ music listeners. In the article, Tan also incorporates interviews with artists drawn from external sources, such as Laura Jane Grace, who discusses how visibility in music helped her through her transition (p.1). Tan positions themselves as an advocate for LGBTQ+ activism in the music industry, highlighting the responsibility of artists to use their platforms for social change. By utilizing statistical data, real-life events, and interviews with artists, Tan attempts to convey the significance of representation while arguing that visibility at times is not enough, and that direct advocacy is what drives industry reform towards a safer space. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tan formats the article by first establishing the significance of LGBTQ+ advocacy in music through statistics on queer music enjoyers and their reliance on music for emotional support (p.1). For example, Tan cites a statistic that claims 53% of LGBTQ+ music enjoyers would be “lost” without music, providing evidence for the argument that representation is necessary to provide a safe space for queer audiences (p.1). Tan then discusses the impact of LGBTQ+ artists like Frank Ocean and Troye Sivan, expressing that when artists share their own queer experiences, fans who “have had a similar experience feel less alone and have someone to look up to (p.3). Finally, they argue that artists have a responsibility to directly advocate for LGBTQ+ rights, citing figures like Madonna and Lady Gaga as examples of musicians using their platforms for activism. Through these authorial choices, Tan asserts that representation alone is insufficient– visibility must be accompanied by direct activism to challenge industry norms and fight discrimination to create a safe space for queer individuals that enjoy music. This argument is important because of its highlight on the power that musicians hold in shaping public discourse and advancing social movements, particularly with regards to LGBTQ+ rights. Tan’s work opens up the discussion about the intersection of entertainment and activism, underscoring the role of music as a platform for activism. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tan’s article presents a compelling argument about the importance of queer representation in the music industry. One of the article’s greatest strengths is its clear argument and purpose, which is consistent throughout the piece. Tan makes a persuasive argument that LGBTQ+ advocacy in music is necessary for challenging discrimination and fostering a safe space by repeatedly and directly stating the main idea throughout the article. Another strength of the article is its well-organized structure, which makes it easy for readers to follow the argument. Tan begins by establishing the problem: lack of support towards queer music listeners in the industry, before moving into a discussion of how artists can be advocates for change. The explicit use of examples in the article also strengthens the article’s persuasiveness. Rather than making broad claims about queer advocacy, Tan supports their points with tangible, recognizable instances of activism. For example, the discussion of Madonna’s protest against the Boy Scout’s ban on gay members demonstrates how artists can leverage their influence for political and social change (p.4). Through these authorial choices, Tan effectively illustrates the different approaches that artists can take to advocate for social change. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite its strengths, the article has several limitations. One of the limitations is its one-sided focus on the musical artists' actions which overlooks the specific impact that queer advocacy has on its audiences. Although Tan conveys that many LGBTQ+ individuals that enjoy music depend on listening to music for comfort, the article does not explicitly discuss how queer listeners engage with music that provide representation or how advocacy from a musical artist influences fans' identity or self-acceptance. The article lacks an analysis of the impact of artist activism and does not examine whether these efforts for change have led to tangible changes in audience perception. For example, although Tan brings up Madonna’s and Lady Gaga’s queer advocacy, the article does not discuss the aftermath of advocacy or provide evidence that advocacy results in benefits towards queer individuals that enjoy music. Another area for improvement is the article’s repetitive examples of artist advocacy. Tan lists several case analyses of artists who have advocated for LGBTQ+ rights, but many of these examples serve the same purpose of emphasizing the importance of advocacy without introducing new dimensions to the argument. A more varied approach, such as analyzing differences in LGBTQ+ representation and advocacy between the pop, hip-hop, and rock industries, or providing case studies from different perspectives that include the music listeners' point of views would provide a more holistic argument.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This article effectively emphasizes the importance of LGBTQ+ representation in music, shows the different approaches to queer advocacy, and emphasizes musical artists’ responsibility in queer advocacy. Its strong organization and well-supported examples make a persuasive argument for advocacy as a tool for change. However, a broader discussion on queer advocacy’s impact on music listeners and a more diverse selection of case studies from different perspectives would strengthen the argument. Despite these limitations, Tan’s work reinforces the idea that music is not just a form of entertainment but a platform for necessary social change.</span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;"><strong><a href="https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1020&amp;context=backstage-pass" style="color: #000000; text-decoration: underline;">Check out Tan's Article!</a></strong></span></p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
