The song sheds light on the experiences of queer women who are often reduced to experiments or fleeting romantic encounters by closeted or seemingly straight women. Rapp contrasts an upbeat, pop-driven melody with melancholic lyrics, highlighting the emotional ups and downs that defines many queer experiences. Building on this duality, this project explores how “Pretty Girls” captures the duality within queer and sapphic identity, drawing on a music review of one of Rapp’s live performances of the song, an essay on the importance of LGBTQ+ advocacy in music, a playlist and listening guide on a sapphic love story, and a music video analysis. Through these discussions, this project will show how “Pretty Girls” contributes to broader conversations about LGBTQ+ visibility and representation in pop music, while engaging with the larger discourse surrounding queer identity in mainstream media.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In “Pretty Girls,” Rapp critiques the emotional toll queer women face when treated as experiments, telling the story of a queer woman’s nightclub encounter with a seemingly straight girl. The song captures the thrill of queer exploration alongside the pain of being reduced to a passing curiosity. The contrast between the upbeat melody and the melancholic lyrics captures the bittersweet nature of many queer experiences– balancing excitement with emotional vulnerability. In the “Music Video analysis,” the visual storytelling of this situation will be discussed and explored. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br><br></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rapp’s vocal delivery enhances this emotional contrast, shifting between playful energy evoking a nightclub setting and of raw vulnerability reflecting the aftermath. In an interview with Jett Tattersall, Rapp reflects, “you take a situation and just kind of say, ‘it is what it is.’ And that doesn’t mean that it doesn’t affect me… It is just what is happening” (Rapp, in Tattersall 2023). This sentiment is shown in the lyric “it’s a blessing and it’s a curse,” capturing both the joy and the emotional cost of the experience (Rapp). In a podcast with Apple Music, Rapp also discusses the tension between self-confidence and self-awareness, noting, “just because I put something in a song that is my feeling doesn’t mean that I’m proud of that feeling” (Rapp, in Apple Music 2023). Her willingness to confront these emotions with honesty results in a compelling portrayal of queer identity. As explored in “Live Performance Review,” this candid approach draws listeners in, with the emotional complexity of the lyrics complementing the catchy production, creating a track that resonates deeply.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Pretty Girls” fits seamlessly within the sapphic pop movement, alongside artists like Chappell Roan, Katy Perry, and MUNA, who have explored similar themes in their music. Rapp’s contribution stands out for its unfiltered honesty, offering a refreshing perspective to the often commodified representations of queer love in mainstream media. “A Sapphic Love Story Told Through Songs” positions “Pretty Girls” within a narrative of the sapphic experience, pairing it with songs by artists like Clairo and Girl in Red to underscore queerness as a multifaceted journey of joy, pain, confidence, and hesitation. In this context, Rapp’s song stands out for its refusal to portray queer relationships as a one-dimensional experience. Alongside tracks by other queer artists, Rapp embraces emotional complexity and helps expand LGBTQ+ representation in pop music through “Pretty Girls.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond storytelling, Rapp’s work, particularly in “Pretty Girls,” aligns with broader conversations about LGBTQ+ visibility and advocacy in the music industry. Joey Tan, in an article on queer representation in the music industry, argues that artists should use their platforms to create safe spaces and drive tangible industry change through their actions (Tan 2018). In “The Importance of LGBTQ+ Advocacy in Music” further on in this project, the way Rapp embodies this advocacy by openly sharing her identity and creating a supportive space for her queer fans is further explored and discussed, specifically with reference to how “Pretty Girls” not only provides visibility for queer women, but also challenges the music industry’s tendency to commodify queer identities, particularly those of women. The challenges that queer artists face in achieving mainstream success and recognition are also addressed by Joshua Glass, who highlights how queer musicians often struggle to gain the same visibility as their non-minority counterparts (Glass 2018). Rapp pushes back against these limitations by embracing her identity and fostering a tight-knitted fanbase, demonstrating the demand for authentic queer representation in pop music. Her growing success reflects a shift toward more inclusive narratives, where LGBTQ+ youth can see their experiences validated in mainstream culture. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This project, hosted on a Publii website, houses each component which can be easily accessed through the Home page. After the Introduction page, the Home page links to the four main articles: “The Importance of LGBTQ+ Advocacy in Music,” “Live Performance Review,” “A Sapphic Love Story Told Through Songs,” and the “Music Video Analysis.” Each main article page includes a button leading to the concluding page which wraps up the project and links to the Bibliography containing all cited sources. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Pretty Girls” by Reneé Rapp offers a nuanced portrayal of queer identity, addressing the emotional complexities of bicuriosity and objectification. Through her vocal performance and honest lyricism, Rapp captures the thrill and the emotional weight of queer exploration. The song contributes to sapphic pop and the song’s emphasis on authenticity positions it as more than just a pop hit– it is a meaningful contribution to the ongoing conversation about queer advocacy in music. By examining “Pretty Girls” through the lenses of queer romanticization, representation, and audience reception, this project demonstrates how the song challenges industry norms and offers a fresh perspective on queer identity in mainstream pop culture. </span></p><p><br><br></p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
