That split second where romantic tension lingers in the air. But what director Cara Delevinge creates isn’t just another steamy queer fantasy. Instead, she crafts a layered and emotional narrative about the duality of bicuriosity: the exciting high of attraction and the crushing loneliness of being someone's experiment. Through intimate visual storytelling, she brings this relatable experience to life. Let’s break it down. </span></p><p> </p><h3><strong>Part 1: The Spark and the Growing Tension</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We first see Rapp moving through a nightclub alone, her expression unreadable as she navigates the crowd. The camera trails her closely, blurring the surrounding clubbers into shadows. Then, her eyes meet a woman’s in the nightclub. Delevingne lingers on the moment just long enough for the audience to see the shift in Rapp’s expression, from guardedness into curiosity.</span></p><div class="gallery-wrapper"><div class="gallery" data-is-empty="false" data-translation="Add images" data-columns="2"><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/media/posts/8/gallery/Screenshot-2025-04-10-at-16.29.20.png" data-size="2692x1632"><img loading="lazy" src="https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/media/posts/8/gallery/Screenshot-2025-04-10-at-16.29.20-thumbnail.png" alt="Still from the music video, the two girls make eye contact." width="720" height="436"></a></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/media/posts/8/gallery/Screenshot-2025-04-10-at-16.30.08.png" data-size="2570x1572"><img loading="lazy" src="https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/media/posts/8/gallery/Screenshot-2025-04-10-at-16.30.08-thumbnail.png" alt="Still from the music video, Rapp's character walks away from the other girl." width="720" height="440"></a></figure></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then comes the chorus and this kiss. The woman grabs Rapp’s wrist and pulls her in. Delevingne interrupts the moment with flashes of what looks like genuine connection: the two women laughing in a convertible, having a deep conversation in bed, intertwining hands on a rooftop. These aren’t just physical moments; they paint an emotional connection between the two, intimate in a way that makes the audience believe, as Rapp does, that this might be something real and meaningful. Delevingne’s choice to highlight emotional intimacy and not just physical chemistry, sets us up for what’s coming. It makes the eventual betrayal sting more. </span></p><div class="gallery-wrapper"><div class="gallery" data-is-empty="false" data-translation="Add images" data-columns="2"><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/media/posts/8/gallery/Screenshot-2025-04-10-at-16.31.16.png" data-size="2728x1616"><img loading="lazy" src="https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/media/posts/8/gallery/Screenshot-2025-04-10-at-16.31.16-thumbnail.png" alt="Still from the music video, two girls hugging and smiling in a car." width="720" height="427"></a></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/media/posts/8/gallery/Screenshot-2025-04-10-at-16.31.44.png" data-size="2802x1602"><img loading="lazy" src="https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/media/posts/8/gallery/Screenshot-2025-04-10-at-16.31.44-thumbnail.png" alt="Still from the music video, two girls talking on a rooftop." width="720" height="412"></a></figure></div></div><h3> </h3><h3><strong>Part 2: The Unraveling of Physical Connection</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the video progresses, we see the relationship’s evolution, or maybe its reduction, take place. The same spaces that held their emotional intimacy– the rooftop, the bed, the convertible– become backdrops for purely physical encounters. Early in the video, we see full-body shots, smiles exchanged, and intent eye connection. Now, the camera zooms in tight, showing flashes of body parts and cropped kisses. We watched their eyes meet across the rooftop, their smiles during the car ride. But as their relationship shifts, the framing shifts. Delevingne frames the physical connections by tight close-ups of body parts. The camera starts to show incomplete, close-up frames of the characters, omitting their facial expressions to insinuate the physical nature of the relationship. </span></p><div class="gallery-wrapper"><div class="gallery" data-is-empty="false" data-translation="Add images" data-columns="2"><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/media/posts/8/gallery/Screenshot-2025-04-10-at-16.34.28.png" data-size="2744x1530"><img loading="lazy" src="https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/media/posts/8/gallery/Screenshot-2025-04-10-at-16.34.28-thumbnail.png" alt="Still from the music video, close up shot of hands and legs of the characters." width="720" height="401"></a></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/media/posts/8/gallery/Screenshot-2025-04-10-at-16.35.02.png" data-size="2862x1596"><img loading="lazy" src="https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/media/posts/8/gallery/Screenshot-2025-04-10-at-16.35.02-thumbnail.png" alt="Still from the music video, close up shot of a kiss shared between the two." width="720" height="402"></a></figure></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rooftop that once housed their quiet conversations now only holds their silhouettes making out in the dark. The bed where they used to have intimate conversations becomes just a place for hookups. Adding on to the strain, intercut with these moments are shots of Rapp singing directly into the camera, back in the club, surrounded by party goers dancing and making out. While the crowd loses themselves in the chaos, Rapp stays present– her eyes locked on the audience, singing about the betrayal of being used as an experiment by someone she genuinely cared about. </span></p><div class="gallery-wrapper"><div class="gallery" data-is-empty="false" data-translation="Add images" data-columns="2"><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/media/posts/8/gallery/Screenshot-2025-04-10-at-16.35.46.png" data-size="2984x1564"><img loading="lazy" src="https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/media/posts/8/gallery/Screenshot-2025-04-10-at-16.35.46-thumbnail.png" alt="Still from the music video, aerial view of Rapp singing to camera with partygoers in the background." width="720" height="377"></a></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/media/posts/8/gallery/Screenshot-2025-04-10-at-16.37.28.png" data-size="2980x1554"><img loading="lazy" src="https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/media/posts/8/gallery/Screenshot-2025-04-10-at-16.37.28-thumbnail.png" alt="Still from the music video, front view of Rapp singing to camera with partygoers in the background." width="720" height="375"></a></figure></div></div><h3> </h3><h3><strong>Part 3: The Gut Punch of Betrayal</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then, the final blow. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re lost in these quick flashes of the two women kissing– the rooftop, the car, the bed. Then, without warning, the screen cuts to the woman making out with her boyfriend in the exact same club where she first kissed Rapp. One second we’re wrapped up in the intensity of their emotion and physical connection, the next we’re staring at proof that to the woman, it never meant anything special.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rapp just stands there. No shouting, no tears. Just her standing there in the crowd, surrounded by people too drunk to notice her world collapsing and the couple too busy and preoccupied with each other. She watches the person she thought she connected with fall back into heteronormativity like nothing ever happened.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The camera lingers on Rapp’s face just long enough to show the exact moment she realizes: this was never going to be real. She was used in an experiment. </span></p><div class="gallery-wrapper"><div class="gallery" data-is-empty="false" data-translation="Add images" data-columns="2"><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/media/posts/8/gallery/Screenshot-2025-04-10-at-16.38.23.png" data-size="2986x1612"><img loading="lazy" src="https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/media/posts/8/gallery/Screenshot-2025-04-10-at-16.38.23-thumbnail.png" alt="Still from the music video, the other girl kissing a man." width="720" height="389"></a></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/media/posts/8/gallery/Screenshot-2025-04-10-at-16.39.01.png" data-size="2866x1652"><img loading="lazy" src="https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/media/posts/8/gallery/Screenshot-2025-04-10-at-16.39.01-thumbnail.png" alt="Still from the music video, Rapp looks shocked and confused." width="720" height="415"></a></figure></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And just like that, Rapp disappears into the faceless crowd where their story began. No grand finale, no one last look. As the lyric “keep on pretending, pretty girl” plays, it lands with bittersweet resignation: both women losing in different ways. Rapp walks away carrying the sting of being someone’s experiment, while the other woman remains trapped in her own performance. </span></p><h2><strong>Conclusion: The Bittersweet Duality of Bicuriosity</strong></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The music video of “Pretty Girls” captures the emotional complexity of queer experimentation with honesty. Through Rapp’s journey from hopeful connection to quiet resignation, the video mirrors a reality many queer women know too well: being treated as an experiment rather than a real partner.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delevingne also subtly highlights a painful societal truth: straight relationships are still treated as the default, while queer ones are often dismissed as detours or temporary experiments. When the other woman chooses her boyfriend, she’s not just rejecting Rapp—she’s choosing the safer, more socially rewarded path. As Abby Monteil writes in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Them</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, sapphic artists like Rapp are navigating a moment of increased visibility that comes with its own set of contradictions. While queer women in pop are finally gaining recognition, they’re also under pressure to represent their identities in ways that are palatable to mainstream audiences (Monteil, 2024). This often means facing a double standard: being celebrated for their queerness when it feels trendy, but sidelined or questioned when it becomes too real, too emotional, or too complicated. Rapp’s heartbreak in “Pretty Girls</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> isn’t just personal– it reflects the emotional cost of living authentically in a world that still rewards conformity.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What makes Delevingne's direction so powerful is her refusal to cast blame. Delevingne doesn’t cast either of the women as the clear villain, but portrays both of them as people navigating their own truths. Bicuriosity isn’t painted as glamorous or shameful– it’s just human. And for queer viewers, seeing this complex experience reflected without judgment is what makes “Pretty Girls” feel so validating, even when it hurts.</span></p><p> </p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://arielslai.github.io/music1701-PrettyGirls/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
